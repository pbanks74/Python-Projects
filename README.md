# Python Projects

The Tech Academy's Python Course was a large focus and one of my favorites. It consisted of many assignments and projects covering Python basics, OOP, Django framework, SQL, modules and database management. Highlighted below are a few projects I created in Python while navigating through The Tech Academy's course.

## Projects

* [Check Files GUI](https://github.com/pbanks74/Python-Projects/blob/main/file_transfer_assignment_2/file_transfer_2.py)
* [Phonebook](https://github.com/pbanks74/Python-Projects/tree/main/phonebook_app)
* [Checkbook](https://github.com/pbanks74/Python-Projects/tree/main/Django_Checkbook)
* [Django University](https://github.com/pbanks74/Python-Projects/tree/main/DjangoUniversity)

### Check Files GUI
Created using Python and tkinter, this program allows the user to choose a source directory and a destination directory. All files in the source directory that have been created or modified within the past 24 hours are transfered and saved in a database.

### Phonebook
This program functions as a phonebook for users. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.

### Checkbook
Web application created using the Django framework that allows users to create a profile and declare a starting balance. Application calculates transactions and keeps track of users current balance. Utilizes sqlite to store user info in a database.

### Django University
Web Application created using Django framework with basic CRUD functionality that allows users to create profiles and specify what courses they are enrolled in.

## Conclusion

The Tech Academy's Python Course taught me Python basics and how to utilize the Django framework to create dynamic applications while strengthening my understanding of Object-oriented programming.
